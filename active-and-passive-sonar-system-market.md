<p><h1>Active and Passive Sonar System Market Size 2024 - 2031 Global Industrial Analysis, Market Share, Top Key Players, Product Types and Forecast Research Report</h1></p><p><strong>Active and Passive Sonar System Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Active and passive sonar systems are essential technologies used primarily in naval applications for detecting and tracking underwater objects. Active sonar emits sound pulses and listens for echoes, providing precise location and distance information. In contrast, passive sonar relies on listening for sounds made by submarines, marine life, and other underwater activities, without emitting its own signals, making it stealthier.</p><p>The Active and Passive Sonar System Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% during the forecast period. This growth is driven by increasing defense expenditure globally, advancements in sonar technology, and the rising need for maritime security. Market trends indicate a shift towards integrated systems that combine both active and passive capabilities, enhancing operational efficiency. Additionally, the growing demand for underwater surveillance in commercial sectors, such as oil and gas exploration and marine research, is further propelling market expansion. Emerging innovations like underwater drones and AI-enabled sonar systems are also poised to reshape the landscape, providing enhanced detection capabilities and operational efficiencies. Overall, the active and passive sonar market is positioned for significant growth as nations prioritize their naval defense capabilities and explore underwater environments.</p></p>
