<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cellulolytic Enzymes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>EG</li><li>CBH</li><li>BG</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cellulolytic enzymes market includes three primary types: endoglucanases (EG), cellobiohydrolases (CBH), and beta-glucosidases (BG). Endoglucanases (EG) act on internal bonds in cellulose, disrupting the fiber structure and enhancing access for other enzymes. Cellobiohydrolases (CBH) hydrolyze cellulose into cellobiose, resulting in shorter chains. Beta-glucosidases (BG) further break down cellobiose into glucose, completing the degradation process. Together, these enzymes play a crucial role in industries like biofuels, textiles, and food, by improving cellulose breakdown and maximizing sugar yield.</p></p>
