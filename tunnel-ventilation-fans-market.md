<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tunnel Ventilation Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Jet Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The tunnel ventilation fans market is primarily divided into two types: axial fans and jet fans. Axial fans are designed to move air along the axis of the fan, making them effective for high-volume airflow with low resistance, ideal for long tunnels. Jet fans, on the other hand, utilize high-velocity jets of air to enhance air movement and control smoke in tunnels, particularly in emergency situations. Both types play crucial roles in ensuring safe and efficient airflow in underground environments.</p></p>
